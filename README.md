# Automated Online Grocery Shopping with Sainsbury's

This project contains a Java application which allows a Sainsbury’s online customer to supply a shopping list in JSON form and place an order with no manual intervention except for the provision of login credentials and the selection of one’s desired delivery slot via the UI.

Work is in progress to integrate Amazon Alexa so that voice-activated ordering is available
